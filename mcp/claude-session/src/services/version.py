"""
Claude Code version detection utilities.

Provides functions to extract Claude Code version from:
1. Running process (via PID and executable path)
2. Session JSONL records (version field in records)

The process-based approach is preferred as it reflects the CURRENT version
performing an operation, not historical versions from when records were written.
