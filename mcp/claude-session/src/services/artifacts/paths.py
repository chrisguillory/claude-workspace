    Extract the source project path from session records.

    Claude Code encodes working directory paths for filesystem safety:
    - `/` → `-`
    - `.` → `-`
    - ` ` → `-`
    - `~` → `-`

    This encoding is **lossy** - you cannot reliably decode it back.
    For example, `-claude-session-mcp` could be:
    - `/claude/session/mcp` (three directories)
    - `/claude-session-mcp` (one directory with dashes)
    - `/claude.session.mcp` (one directory with dots)

    Instead of decoding, this function extracts the actual path from the
    'cwd' field of session records, which contains the true filesystem path.

    Args:
        files_data: Mapping of filename -> sequence of SessionRecord

    Returns:
        Source project path extracted from record cwd fields

    Raises:
        MissingCwdError: If no cwd field found in any record (corrupt session)
